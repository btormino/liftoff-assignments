[^1]: Okay, got the right picture links.  Should work now. HOWEVER, I'm wildly unhappy with the size and I'm going to look into how to resize them. I am guessing that like "specifying the theme an image is shown to" on the "get started with writing and formatting on github" page from the text, it will be something to do with using HTML.
